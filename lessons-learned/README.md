# Lessons Learned

This folder contains "blog posts" that conclude the experience I've collected while working on this project. This is my own personal experience which you may find to be true, or not, it depends on your perspective. Also, expect these posts to be updated as the project matures. 

Eventually, I might release these writings somewhere (on Medium maybe) so they'd reach more publicity. However, for now at least, I consider these posts to be some kind of self-deocumentation and reflection on my own work.
